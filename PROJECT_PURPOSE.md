# Why This Project Exists

## The Problem

Existing proofreading tools fail users with dyslexia because they:
- **Assume users can spot mistakes** - but dyslexic users often can't
- **Fix only minor errors** - missing sentence flow and readability issues  
- **Judge user's style** - assuming tone and layout are wrong
- **Provide piecemeal fixes** - not comprehensive improvements

## The Solution: AI + Good Prompts

Large Language Models excel where traditional tools fail:
- **Contextual understanding** - analyzes entire sentences, not just errors
- **Voice preservation** - improves clarity while keeping author's intent
- **Comprehensive fixes** - handles grammar, flow, and readability together
- **Privacy options** - local processing with Ollama keeps data private

## Development Story

This extension was **primarily built by Claude AI** because:

1. **Learning experiment** - human developer had limited extension experience
2. **AI capability test** - exploring what Claude could accomplish
3. **Collaboration research** - testing human-AI development partnership
4. **Real problem solving** - addressing actual accessibility needs

## Key Innovation

- **Dyslexia-focused design** - comprehensive text improvement, not error hunting
- **Privacy-first** - local LLM option (Ollama) keeps sensitive text private
- **Multi-browser** - works on Chrome, Edge, and Firefox
- **Context-aware** - adapts to different websites and writing contexts
- **AI-human collaboration** - demonstrates purposeful AI application

This project shows how AI can help create better accessibility tools when guided by real user needs.
