# AI Text Proofreader: Development Story

## Quick Facts

- **Built by**: Claude AI (with human guidance)
- **Purpose**: Better proofreading tools for dyslexic users
- **Innovation**: AI-human collaboration in accessibility software

## Why It Exists

Traditional proofreading tools assume users can spot their mistakes and only fix minor errors. This fails dyslexic users who need comprehensive text improvements that preserve their voice.

## Key Features

- **Local privacy** - Ollama keeps text on your computer
- **Context understanding** - fixes entire sentences, not just grammar
- **Multi-browser** - Chrome, Edge, Firefox support
- **Dyslexia-friendly** - comprehensive improvements without judgment

## Development Approach

Human provided requirements and testing; Claude AI wrote most of the code. This collaboration demonstrates how AI can create better accessibility tools when guided by real user needs.
